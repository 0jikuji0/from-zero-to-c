/**
 * Exercise 28: Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju Algorithm)
 * Difficulty: ***** (5/5)
 * 
 * Find all strongly connected components in a directed graph using Kosaraju algorithm.
 * A strongly connected component is a maximal set of vertices where every vertex
 * is reachable from every other vertex.
 * 
 * Input:
 * - First line: number of vertices (n) and edges (m)
 * - Next m lines: edges (u v) representing directed edges
 * 
 * Output:
 * - Print the number of strongly connected components
 * - Print vertices in each component
